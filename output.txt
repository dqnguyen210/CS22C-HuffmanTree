In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of
optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of
finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm
developed by David A. Huffman while he was a student at MIT, and published in the
1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for
encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table
from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible
value of the source symbol. As in other entropy encoding methods, more common
symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols.
Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the
number of input weights if these weights are sorted. However, although optimal among
methods encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all
compression methods.
